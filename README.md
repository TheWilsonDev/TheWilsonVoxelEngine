Making a voxel engine because I saw some on youtube and thought it would be a great project to learn C++ and OpenGL.

Goals for the engine:
- Chunk Based Rendering
- Greedy Meshes
- High Instance Counts
- Procedural Generation
- High voxel quality
- Multi Cam Setup
- UI with ImGui
- Destroying and Creating voxels (small and large scale)

Speculative goals for the engine:
- Physics
- Water simulation
- Using a "LOD"/"Nanite" algorithm but for voxels to render voxels super far away
- Raytracing Light
- Raytracing Sound engine
